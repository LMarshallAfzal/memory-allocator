# Memory Allocator

A basic memory allocator implementation, focusing on the core processes of `malloc()` and `free()`, which are the standard interfaces for dynamic memory allocation in C. It's designed to provide a foundational understanding of memory management at a lower level, similar to how the system's dynamic memory allocation works.
